_vimrc
======

My config file of gVim

This is the local vimrc set of [spf13-vim](https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim), here is the usage:
1. Create a link of .vimrc.local to %HOME%/.vimrc.local
2. Run :BundleInstall in gvim
3. Copy all the files in YouCompleteMe folder to %HOME%/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe/python folder. It is a better auto-complete plugin than neocomplcache
